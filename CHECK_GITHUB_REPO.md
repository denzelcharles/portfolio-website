# How to Check if You Have a GitHub Repository

## Method 1: Check Your GitHub Profile

1. **Go to your GitHub profile**: 
   - Visit: https://github.com/denzelcharles
   - Or search for your username on GitHub

2. **Look at your repositories**:
   - You'll see a list of all your repositories
   - Look for one named:
     - `portfolio-website`
     - `denzel-portfolio`
     - `portfolio`
     - Or any name you might have used

3. **If you see a repository**:
   - Click on it
   - Copy the URL from your browser (it will look like: `https://github.com/denzelcharles/portfolio-website`)
   - Share that URL with me and I'll help you connect it!

## Method 2: Check Your Local Git Configuration

I've already checked your local repository - you don't have a remote configured yet, which means:
- ✅ Your code is saved locally
- ❌ It's not connected to GitHub yet
- ✅ You need to create a new repository on GitHub

## Method 3: Check GitHub's "New Repository" Page

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. If you see a dropdown that says "Owner: denzelcharles", you're logged in
3. If you see a list of existing repositories, you can check if `portfolio-website` is there
4. If it's not in the list, you need to create it!

## What You Should See

### ✅ If You HAVE a Repository:
- You'll see it at: `https://github.com/denzelcharles/portfolio-website`
- It might be empty (just has a README)
- That's okay! We can push your code to it

### ❌ If You DON'T Have a Repository:
- You won't see `portfolio-website` in your repositories list
- You need to create one (I'll help you!)

## Quick Check Command

After you create a repository, you can verify it's connected by running:
```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see something like:
```
origin  https://github.com/denzelcharles/portfolio-website.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/denzelcharles/portfolio-website.git (push)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Check your GitHub profile**: https://github.com/denzelcharles
2. **Look for a repository** named `portfolio-website` or similar
3. **If you find one**: Share the URL with me!
4. **If you don't find one**: I'll help you create it!

**Tip**: The `pitch-rise-verification` repository you shared is separate - that's for verification, not your portfolio. Your portfolio needs its own repository!

# 🚀 Push Your Portfolio to GitHub

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. **Repository name**: `portfolio-website` (or `denzel-portfolio`)
3. **Description**: "Personal portfolio website built with Next.js 14"
4. **Visibility**: Choose **Public** (recommended for portfolios - free hosting on Vercel)
5. **DO NOT** check:
   - ❌ "Add a README file"
   - ❌ "Add .gitignore"
   - ❌ "Choose a license"
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect and Push Your Code

After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\iatfp\Denzel AI"
git remote add origin https://github.com/denzelcharles/portfolio-website.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** Replace `portfolio-website` with whatever name you chose in Step 1.

## Step 3: Verify

1. Go to your new repository: `https://github.com/denzelcharles/portfolio-website`
2. You should see all your files there! 🎉
